\title{Map the spread of SLF in the U.S.}
\usage{
map_spread(
  resolution = "10k",
  zoom = "range",
  xlim_coord = NULL,
  ylim_coord = NULL,
  rarefy = TRUE,
  color_palette = "plasma",
  print_message = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{resolution}{Defines the resolution at which the data is displayed. `"1k"` resolution shows data aggregated at a 1km2 grid, while `"10k"` shows tiles aggregated at a 10km2 grid}

\item{zoom}{Defines the limits of the map to be plotted. `"range"` limits the map to the established range for SLF; `"full"` displays the whole United States. `"custom"` the user to specify the range over which the map should be displayed (see `xlim_coord, ylim_coord` below).}

\item{xlim_coord, ylim_coord}{Ordered numerical vectors of length 2 determining the longitudinal (`xlim`) and latitudinal (`ylim`) boundaries of the map, to be expressed as decimal degree coordinates. Unnecessary if zoom is set to any value other than `"custom"`}

\item{rarefy}{Logical value (`TRUE/FALSE`). Specifies whether the data should be summarized for faster plotting. Overwritten and set to `TRUE` when zoom is full and/or the resolution is 10k.}

\item{color_palette}{A character string indicating the color option to use. Five options are available: "magma" (or "A"), "inferno" (or "B"), "plasma" (or "C"), "viridis" (or "D", the default option) and "cividis" (or "E").}

\item{print_message}{Logical value. Can be set to `FALSE` to shut down the warning on run time.}
}
\value{
A ggplot of the spread of SLF
}
\description{
The function takes a dataset of SLF occurrences and displays a map of the spread over time.
The "zoom" option allows for a customized focus of the map
