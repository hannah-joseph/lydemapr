\title{Spatial dataset for SLF presence at 1km resolution}
\format{
A dataframe with 658,390 observations and 14 variables
\describe{
  \item{source}{Character variable defining the source of the data.}
  \item{year}{Integer value defining the calendar year when the information was collected.}
  \item{bio_year}{Integer value definig the biological year when the information was collected based on SLF life cycle. Biological year starts on May 1st and ends on April 30th.}
  \item{latitude}{Expressed in decimal degrees in WSG84 coordinate system}
  \item{longitude}{Expressed in decimal degrees in WSG84 coordinate system}
  \item{state}{Character defining the state where the data was collected, abbreviated with Census-official 2-letter code}
  \item{lyde_present}{Logical value (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) defining whether records are present for spotted lanternfly at the site at the time of survey. These might include regulatory incidents where a single live individual or a small number of dead individuals were observed at the site, but no signs of established population could be detected.}
  \item{lyde_established}{Logical value (`TRUE`/`FALSE`) defining whether signs of an established population are present at the site at the time of survey. These include a minimum of 2 alive individuals or the presence of an egg mass.}
  \item{lyde_density}{Ordinal variable defining the population density of spotted lanternfly at the site, estimated directly as an ordinal category by the data collector or derived from count data. The categories include: `“Unpopulated”`, indicating the absence of an established population at the site (but not excluding the presence of spotted lanternfly in the form of regulatory incidents); `“Low”`, indicating an established population is present but at low densities, reflecting at most about 30 individuals or a single egg mass; `“Medium”`, indicating the population is established and at higher densities, but still at low enough population size to allow for a counting of the individuals during a survey visit (a few hundreds at most); `“High”`, indicating the population is established and thriving, and the area is generally infested, to a degree where a count of individuals would be unfeasible within a survey visit.}
  \item{source_agency}{Agency/organization/platform responsible for data collection. `DDA`: Delaware Dept of Agriculture; `iNaturalist`: inaturalist.org; `ISDA`: Indiana State Dept of Agriculture; `MDA`: Maryland Dept of Agriculture; `NJDA_Public_reporting`: New Jersey Dept of Agriculture public reporting tool platform; `NYSDAM`: New York State Dept of Agriculture and Markets; `PDA_Public_reporting`:  Pennsylvania Dept of Agriculture public reporting tool platform; `USDA`: United States Dept of Agriculture; `VA_Tech_Coop_Ext`: Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, and Virginia Cooperative Extension; `VDA`: Virginia Dept of Agricuture.}
  \item{collection_method}{Character string defining the method used for data collection. `field_survey/management` for data points collected by professionals during field operations; `individual_reporting` for data points collected by individuals through public reporting tools, inatualist observations, or citizen science projects.}
  \item{pointID}{Character string uniquely identifying each data point.}
  \item{rounded_longitude_10k}{longitude of the centroid of the closest 10 km2 grid cell, expressed in decimal degrees (WSG84 coordinate system), used to rarefy the dataset at a coarser resolution.}
  \item{rounded_latitude_10k}{latitude of the centroid of the closest 10 km2 grid cell, expressed in decimal degrees (WSG84 coordinate system), used to rarefy the dataset at a coarser resolution.}
